# cognitive_datasci
This was a group assignment in my Cognitive Data Science course (COG260H) at the University of Toronto, that aimed to predict across languages, the colour to be most representative of a particular colour category within a given language.

Used Jupyter. 

Please read COG260_project_final_report.pdf for a better understanding of the goal of this project and statistical conclusions made.
