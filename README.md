# cognitive_datasci
This was a group assignment in my Cognitive Data Science course (COG260H) at the University of Toronto that aimed to predict across languages, the colour to be most representative of a particular colour category within a given language.

The main project file is COG260_project.ipynb. When this file runs, it accesses text files from the WCS_data_core folder, and functions from wcs_helper_functions_alt.ipynb. For quick access to the project without using Jupyter, the file COG260_jupyter_code.pdf has the code of COG260_project.ipynb with the printed results during a full run. 

Please read COG260_project_final_report.pdf for a better understanding of the goal of this project and the statistical conclusions made.
