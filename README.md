# cognitive_datasci
This was a group assignment in my Cognitive Data Science course (COG260H) at the University of Toronto, that aimed to predict across languages, the colour to be most representative of a particular colour category within a given language.

Used Jupyter. For quick access to the project without Jupyter, the file COG260_jupyter_code.pdf has the project along with the printed results during a full run. 

Please read COG260_project_final_report.pdf for a better understanding of the goal of this project and the statistical conclusions made.
